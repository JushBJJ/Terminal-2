<h1> Terminal 2 </h1>

Linux support will come soon when I think it is ready.


<h1>How to compile [Windows] </h1>

1. Download MinGW with GCC installed

2. Go to the terminal2 directory (Most likely you may have saved it in C:/users/YOURUSERNAME/desktop)

4. Go to your command prompt and type in "gcc Terminal.c -o Terminal.exe"

5. Errors will pop up if there are obviously code errors if you have modified the terminal. Else, nothing will be outputted
